"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can generate a positive reputation for a company leading to
possibly more sales and growth. According to Jones et al (2019), a corporation that invests in the
environmental and ethical approaches of CSR will demonstrate to the public and the media that
they are a responsible company. Watson (2018) provides evidence that this improves consumer
sales as customers tend to support ethical green business practice thus improving profitability and
encouraging growth. For example, a yoghurt company called Yeo Valley has been investing in
making its products organic, creating fully recyclable packaging and reducing its CO2 output. As a
result, profits have doubled within the last two years providing the company with a range of
opportunities to expand (Peterson, 2019). Overall, the evidence seems to suggest that investing in

CSR can improve brand image and productivity.
